# 📊 AutoGluon Automated ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates a **fully automated end-to-end AutoML workflow** built using **AutoGluon**, capable of handling:

- Dataset ingestion  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Ensembling  
- Prediction generation  

—all with **minimal human intervention**.

##  Project Overview

After uploading a dataset containing **891 rows**, the AutoML pipeline:

1. Evaluated multiple model families  
2. Performed hyperparameter optimization  
3. Built an ensemble of the top-performing models  
4. Selected the best model based on validation performance  

The final outcome was a **Random Forest model achieving 93.6% accuracy**.

##  How the System Works

The pipeline streamlines the entire machine learning workflow—from **raw data → production-ready model**—by automating every core step:

- **EDA & Feature Engineering:** Automatically extracts insights and prepares features  
- **Model Search:** Trains diverse algorithms under the hood  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Tunes model parameters intelligently  
- **Ensemble Building:** Combines top candidates to improve robustness  
- **Prediction Generation:** Produces final outputs ready for evaluation or deployment  

This automation eliminates the need for manual tuning while still delivering **high-performance ML pipelines**.
